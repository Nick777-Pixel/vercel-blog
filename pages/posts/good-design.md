# Good Design

![A x/y chart of Good Design and Fancy Design](../../public/images/good-design.png)

The other day I was chatting with [Paco](https://paco.me) about this. Sometimes we’ve been focusing on the fancy things too much and forgotten about the goal. The word “fancy” can be changed to a lot of other things too. In general, “goodness” doesn’t scale linearly with the complexity of the design.

In the past years, we ditched all the lights, shadows, and textures in our UI designs. And now we are slowly adding them back. This is not an argument about flat design and skeuomorphism design, nor a step back but moving forward by understanding design better.

It’s like the [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) algorithm. Over time, we move and test, again and again, and we seem to be closer to the best result in our sights.

But unfortunately, the “good result”—that peak on our previous chart, is a moving target. We get bored with the same aesthetics every once in a while, and the environment changes rapidly as well. The term “trend”, describes the shape of good design in people’s minds at a certain time.

The variable is **time**. When chasing the trend, we are chasing a moving target. We do new designs every year for the same old things, not as an improvement, but for following the trend.

I want to decorrelate time from my design. I want understand _design_ better, and find the non-exsiting _good design_, that is beyond the past, now, and future. As Dieter Rams said, good design is timeless.
